# Raspberry-Pi-Environment-Monitor
This project was finished following Dr. Peter Dalmaris's Udemy course: Tech Explorationsâ„¢ Raspberry Pi: Full Stack. Course URL: https://www.udemy.com/rpi-full-stack/learn/v4/overview

The project was implemented on a Raspberry Pi. A DHT-22 sensor was used to measure the humidity and temperature in a room, and the sensor readings will be rendered by the web application. Old data would be stored in SQLite 3 database for future reference.

Cron Schedule was set up to acquire real-time data. For analysis purpose, the user can view data in any time range and plots will be generated to visualize the trend.
