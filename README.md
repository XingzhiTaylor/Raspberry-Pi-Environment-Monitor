# Raspberry-Pi-Environment-Monitor
This project was finished following Dr. Peter Dalmaris's Udemy course: Tech Explorationsâ„¢ Raspberry Pi: Full Stack. Course url: https://www.udemy.com/rpi-full-stack/learn/v4/overview

The project was implemented on a Raspberry Pi. A DHT-22 sensor was used to measure the humidity and temperature in a room, and the sensor readings will be rendered by the web application. 

Cron Schedule was set up to acquire real time data. For analysis purpose, the user can view data in any time range and plots will be generated to visulize the trend.
